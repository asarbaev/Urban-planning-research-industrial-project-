# Urban planning (industrial project)

1.1 Purpose

The world population is increasing exponentially since 1950, when 30% of globe population was estimated to live in the cities. It is estimated that by 2050 this percentage of urban population will more than double, i.e. almost 70% of the global population is expected to be living in cities. This increasing urbanization level brings new challenges on how to perceive and organize the cities that are about to host that many residents. This question raises among others the problem of economical planning of the cities.
This project concerns what is widely called urban planning, for which various mathematical tools are able to give an unbiased estimation of factors which have an affect upon pricing. In order to build a reasonable model about house prices the largest possible datasets should be used in order to build models which are less likely to be affected by outliers as set out in the law of large numbers. One may consider utilizing real estate prices and information, which give a lot of valuable informations about the economic aspects of the city. Models mentioned above may be able to predict some of the cities dynamics.
However, the problem is that these data sets are not easily available as they are owned by real estate agencies or notaries and as a consequence access to these data is rather expensive or simply not possible. In spite of this, it is assumed that enough data may be obtained from Internet pages where people rent, buy, or sell houses and apartments.

1.2 Overview

The project consisted of four main parts. 
These were: 
1. Data extraction
2. Text mining
3. House prices estimates 
4. Data visualization

Here presented Python code for first two stages (data extracting and text mining).
